# WoT Map Importer for Unity

A Unity Editor plugin that imports **World of Tanks** maps directly from `.pkg` files
into your Unity project. Inspired by [Simi4/WoT-Blender-Addons](https://github.com/Simi4/WoT-Blender-Addons)
`tank_viewer`, but for Unity.

## Features

- ✅ Reads `arena_defs/_list_.xml` to discover all maps (arenas + hangars)
- ✅ Decodes `*.cdata` chunks (heights PNG, normals, blend_textures DXT5, layer definitions)
- ✅ Imports terrain either as **Mesh Chunks** (recommended, WoT-like raw blending) or as Unity Terrain
- ✅ Replicates WoT's blend-layer logic (new + old formats)
- ✅ Imports layer diffuse + normal textures (PNG/DDS)
- ✅ Loads static objects via `.primitives_processed` (basic geometry + diffuse)
- ⚠️ Atlas shaders / PBS_tiled_atlas: simplified (diffuse only, no per-pixel blend masks)
- ⚠️ Full CompiledSpace (space.bin) parsing not yet implemented; falls back to chunk name → bounds
- ⚠️ Water / sky: not implemented yet

## Requirements

- Unity **2022.3 LTS** or newer (also tested with 2023.x)
- An installed copy of **World of Tanks** (or access to its `res/packages/` folder)
- .NET Standard 2.1 / .NET 4.x scripting backend

## Installation

### Option A: as a local package (Unity Package Manager)
1. Copy the `WoTMapImporter` folder into your project's `Packages/` directory.
2. Unity will pick it up automatically.

### Option B: as Assets
1. Copy the `WoTMapImporter` folder into `Assets/` of your project.
2. The Editor scripts compile into the Editor assembly.

## Usage

1. Open **Tools → WoT Map Importer**.
2. Set the path to your **World of Tanks** installation (e.g. `C:\Games\World_of_Tanks`).
3. Set the **Output Folder** (e.g. `Assets/WoTImported`).
4. Click **"Parse WoT (load maps)"** — wait a few seconds while it reads `scripts.pkg`.
5. Pick a map from the list.
6. Click **"Import Selected Map"**.

By default the importer creates one MeshRenderer per WoT `*.cdata` terrain chunk and uses
`WoT/TerrainChunkMesh` to sample the original WoT blend textures directly. You can still
switch back to the older Unity Terrain mode from the window. Generated meshes, materials,
textures and prefabs are saved under your Output Folder.

## How it works

The plugin reads `.pkg` files (which are just ZIP archives):

- `arena_defs/_list_.xml` — list of all maps
- `arena_defs/<map>.xml` — bounding box, geometry path
- `<map>.pkg` and `<map>_bin.pkg` — actual map data
- `particles.pkg`, `shared*.pkg` — additional resources (textures, models)

Each terrain chunk is a `*.cdata` file (also a ZIP) containing:

- `terrain2/heights1` — PNG with heights encoded in RGB channels
- `terrain2/normals` — PNG (v1) or DXT5 DDS (v2) normal map
- `terrain2/blend_textures` — DXT5 DDS RGBA weights (new format)
- `terrain2/layers` — layer definitions (new format) — u/v projection, name, normal map
- `terrain2/layer 1` … `layer N` — per-layer textures (old format)

### Height decoding (from `terrain_loader.py`)

```
height = (R + G*256 + B_signed*65536) / (1000/256)
where B_signed = B > 0.5 ? B - 1.0039216 : B
```

### Blending (matches the Blender addon)

Each blend texture has RGBA weights. For the **new format**:
- `blend[i].A → layer[2i].weight`
- `blend[i].G → layer[2i+1].weight`

The chain rule from the addon:
```
out[0] = color[0]*w0 + out[1]
out[1] = color[1]*w1 + out[2]
…
out[n-1] = color[n-1]*w_{n-1}
```

The plugin packs these weights into Unity's splat maps (each tile holds 4 layer weights).

## Limitations

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain heightmap | ✅ Full |
| Terrain normals | ✅ Full |
| Terrain blend layers (new) | ✅ Full |
| Terrain blend layers (old) | ✅ Full |
| Terrain tileable UV projection | ⚠️ Approximate — uses 10m default tile size |
| Wetness / global AM map | ⚠️ Disabled by default |
| Static objects (basic) | ✅ Simple diffuse + geometry |
| Atlas shaders (PBS_tiled_atlas) | ⚠️ Diffuse only, no proper blending |
| Water planes | ❌ Not implemented |
| Sky / lighting | ❌ Not implemented |
| CompiledSpace space.bin | ❌ Falls back to cdata-based bounds |
